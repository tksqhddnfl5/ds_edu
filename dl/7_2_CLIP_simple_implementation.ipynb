In a nutshell, this model learns the relationship between a whole sentence and the image it describes; in a sense that when the model is trained, given an input sentence it will be able to retrieve the most related images corresponding to that sentence (and vice versa). The important thing here is that it is trained on full sentences instead of single classes like car, dog, etc. The intuition is that when trained on whole sentences, the model can learn a lot more things and finds some pattern between images and texts.\n","They also show that when this model is trained on a huge dataset of images and their corresponding texts, it can also act as a classifier too. I encourage you to study the paper to learn more about this exciting model and their astonishing results on benchmarking datasets. To mention just one, CLIP model trained with this strategy classifies ImageNet better than those SOTA models trained on the ImageNet itself optimized for the only task of classification!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HDteAZPCi6lS"},"source":["As a **teaser** (!), let's see what the final model that we will build in this article from scratch is capable of: given a query (raw text) like \"a boy jumping with skateboard\" or \"a girl jumping from swing\", the model will retrieve the most relevant images:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sYa6nIYei6lS"},"source":["![](https://i.ibb.co/9gdYqNP/teaser-cropped.png)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ZSvBQoszjYJS"},"outputs":[],"source":["# !pip install timm\n","# !pip install transformers"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"bvXzfQqgi6lT"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_3724\\1385263093.py:12: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found.

What I just said is the most important thing to have in mind to understand this loss function. Let's continue. We talked about two vectors, but, what do we have here? We have image_embeddings, a matrix with shape (batch_size, 256) and text_embeddings with shape (batch_size, 256). Easy enough! it means we have two groups of vectors instead of two single vectors. How do we measure how similar two groups of vectors (two matrices) are to each other? Again, with dot product (@ operator in PyTorch does the dot product or matrix multiplication in this case). To be able to multiply these two matrices together, we transpose the second one. Okay, we get a matrix with shape (batch_size, batch_size) which we will call logits."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IZ88Mer8i6lb"},"source":["Let's consider what we hope that this model learns: **we want it to learn \"similar representations (vectors)\" for a given image and the caption describing it.
